## Homework Description

In homework 7, I was given a prompt for a database, with which I created an ER diagram, created the database in MySQL, added data to the database, and asked the database queries.

The hw7 folder contains the 2 files I edited for this homework.

hw7-ddl.sql is the sql file where I created the database and added data to it. The database keeps track of employee information, as well as skills and roles needed by a company. This information can then be used to construct resumes and search for people based on these roles and skills.

hw7.qmd (and hw7.html) is the report for this homework, where I constructed a crow's foot diagram and connected to the database to ask it queries. Some of these queries were more simple (i.e. just listing data), while others involved more complex relational algebra.
